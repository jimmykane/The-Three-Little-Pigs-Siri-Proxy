The Three Little Pigs siri proxy server is an intelligent server with key throttling and database connection.

**A little info upon public/semipublic servers**

So you got a server and you are afraid if apple will ban your device? Lets get things straight then

1. The Three Little Pigs DO NOT send any XACE-HOST, assistantid,speechid to Apple servers. They also get right of the host header. 

2. Apple doesnt ban by UUID (as far as now!)

3. Apple bans by IP! So use proxychains/Tor/tsocks/torsocks/torify etc to fake the ip and DNS

4. Also keep in mind that there is a limit on how many assistants you can create per key per day. I am not sure but 30 is an average. Please correct me if I am mistaken. There will be a new release soon where there will be a limit on that and hopefully this issue will be resolved.

To the point: You got a 4S, you get commandFailed and/or cannot create assistantid? 

Solution 1: Change IP/Network

Solution 2: Delete the /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.plist on the phone (jailbreak req). You can do this by putting `cydia://package/mobi.macciti.assistantdelete` in safari on your iDevice, or just search `assistantdelete` in cydia.

Solution 3: Use other iPhone4s DATA



__if you Jailbrake an iPhone 4S. Just add http://cydia.myrepospace.com/thpryrchn/ to your cydia Sources, and install `Spire 4S` on your 4S. Then you can point it to your server just like you do with any other iPhone 4. This will work on all iOS 5 versions. Also works if you install a Siri GUI that does not include Spire.. It only adds the spire settings, and will not install siri on devices without siri.__



Version 0.9.13 
---------------------
* iPhone 4S now is added to client table. That phone will most likely need the __com.apple.assistant.plist__ in order to get it in the database. You can do this by putting `cydia://package/mobi.macciti.assistantdelete` in safari on your iDevice, or just search `assistantdelete` in cydia.

* Fixes and tweeks. 

    Better iPad 3 key tracking. Will be counted in max connections if *try_iPad3* is enabled.

    When you ask "How many keys are avalible" it will tell you how many of each are avalible.

* New option in config.yml

  `clients_must_be_in_database` When set to "true", this will only allow a device that is in the users database to connect on a public serverâ€¦ Making it semi-private. The client will most likely have to delete their `com.apple.assistant.plist` in order to use the server. This setting doesn't apply to 4S's.
  
 ** Update How **
 
 From Version 0.9.12, a `siriproxy update` will work fine, and if you want to add the new option in your config.yml, you can, but it will work just fine without it. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, follow the instructions in the Version 0.9.12.




Version 0.9.12 
---------------------

* Now saves iPhone 4S and the New iPad (AKA iPad 3) keys, and keeps track separately

* New options in config.yml.  

  `expiration_sesitivity: 0` will now disable expiring of keys due to no response from finish speech (Some clients have invalid assistants that kill them). 

  `hours_till_key_expires: 24` - Put how long you want the keys to last before they expire. Default is 20 if this option isn't in there. 

  `try_iPad3: true` - If there are no 4S keys, it will use iPad3 keys. NOTE: iPad 3 keys only work for dictation. 



** Update How **

* Install phpMyAdmin (google how), and backup your keys, clients, config, etc.

* In the `Three-Little_Pigs` Folder do all these steps and don't forget to regenerate the tables

    gem uninstall siriproxy
    
    git pull

    copy and edit `.config.example.yml` to `~/.siriproxy/config.yml`

    rake install && siriproxy bundle

    siriproxy gentables

* Web Interface install

    copy the contents of WebInterface to your http docs root and run the install script! 

* Restore the stuff you backed up. 


Version 0.9.9 
---------------------

* New web Interface by @WouterDS

* Lots of additions, take a look at the features

** Update How **

* In the `Three-Little_Pigs` Folder do all these steps and dont forget to regenerate the tables

    gem uninstall siriproxy
    
    git pull

    copy and edit `.config.example.yml` to `~/.siriproxy/config.yml`

    rake install && siriproxy bundle

    siriproxy gentables

* Web Interface install

    copy the contents of WebInterface to your http docs root and run the install script! 



Version 0.9.8.3-expr 
---------------------

* Improvements upon activation Token

* Added ip and last login logging for clients 

* Fixed email notification 

* Fixed detection of validation data due to apple not replying back with validation expired

* Added default sensitivity to 5 invalid requests without apple response! You can change that and read more info in config.yml

**Info about the Validation and access token System**

* Go to (http://quartzcoding.blogspot.com/2012/02/siri-validation-data-and-access-token.html)


**UPDATE HOW TO**

* In the `Three-Little_Pigs` Folder do 

    gem uninstall siriproxy
    
    git pull

    copy and edit `.config.example.yml` to `~/.siriproxy/config.yml`

    rake install && siriproxy bundle


-Done


Version 0.9.8.2-expr (This is a beta release! More work is needed)
----------------------------------------------------------------


* Added Temporary fix for Expiration of Validation Data! Now keys in database will be checked every 10 minutes and any key found existing in database longer than 24 hours is set to expired! Working on a better fix.

* Added 4S exploit tnx for helping @xnlzee, Matthew Lau and @786IC0NIC

**UPDATE HOW TO**

* Backup your keys and tables that you need!

* In the `Three-Little_Pigs` Folder do 

    git pull

    copy and edit `.config.example.yml` to `~/.siriproxy/config.yml`

    rake install && siriproxy bundle
    
    siriproxy gentables 

-Done

**The Exploit WARNING!!!! YOU DO THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK**

* More on 

* Steps 

    0. Requires JailBroken iPhone4s! Preferably with Spire installed, and your server address setup on it. So do the following

    1. Go to config.yml and set regenarate_interval to how many seconds you want the iPhone4S generate new Validation Data good value is 15 seconds

    2. Delete /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.plist. You can do this by putting `cydia://package/mobi.macciti.assistantdelete` in safari on your iDevice, or just search `assistantdelete` in cydia.

    4. Respring!!!

    5. Connect to the server and make a request. You should see something like -> "[Exploit - SiriProxy] Command send to iPhone4s to regenerate multiple keys every 15 seconds"

    6. Done. Wait 15 seconds and use Siri again! You should have another key in your DB

    7. Repeat as many times you want! 

    To restore just delete com.apple.assistant.plist again. You can do this by putting `cydia://package/mobi.macciti.assistantdelete` in safari on your iDevice, or just search `assistantdelete` in cydia.



Version 0.9.8-expr (This is a beta release! More work is needed)
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Please keep in mind that you need new clients to delete the`assistnat.plist` in `/var/mobile/Library/com.apple.assistant.plist` or chnage Spire host 

* Also they must have iCloud enabled on their phones!!! -> This on what clients are unique!!!!

* Always reboot after that!!!

* You can also run the server with the following command for less verbose output in the terminal and error logging

     ./siriproxy-restarter 2> error2.log | grep -E 'Processing|NEW Client|OLD Client|RollEyes|Assistant ID|nickname|Happy hour'



**New Features**
 

* New Web Interface by @WouterDS

* 4S Exploit

* Public and private mode

* Authorization :-) -> Requires the client to have an apple account! (97% have!!!) Read here on how to use (http://quartzcoding.blogspot.com/2012/02/three-little-pigs-authentication-system.html)

* Ban Detection. Detects witch keys cannot create more assistants and sets them as banned. Read what this is here (http://quartzcoding.blogspot.com/2012/02/three-little-pigs-authentication-system.html)

* Improved grabber. Now the connection limit wont apply on the 4S devices. Max active connections reached? No problem! :-) 

* Improved Connection dropping

* Now stores counters in database so even after a crash the keyload dropdown works

* Happy hour. When this timers is reached then sets the keys as unbanned in order for new people to connect. Mostly useful by public servers.

* Many many many bug fixes, almost everything reported in github!!!


**Updating from previous versions**

* Just download the experimental branch into a new folder using

    `git clone -b experimental https://github.com/jimmykane/The-Three-Little-Pigs-Siri-Proxy`

* Copy the new config to `~/.siriproxy/` and edit it to your needs

* Do a rake install and a bundle again

    `rake install && siriproxy bundle`

* Regenerate all tables (Warning this will erase everything in the Database so make sure you backup your keys and settings)

    `siriproxy gentables`



Version 0.9ba
-------------

* Re-added Capturing of assistantid's and speechid's just for reference although they are not used

* Added function in web-Interface to manually create a key, and show old expired keys. Coming soon new and improved web Interface

* Improved grabber. Now if the 4S is not setup the keys are saved! 

* Detection of iPad2

* Several bug fixes

* Tutorial for OSX Snow Leoparf, and OSX Lion!!!  Thanks to @Thpryrchn


**Coming soon**

* Assistantid monitor per key and assistant limits!

* Improved web Interface by @Wouter DS


Version 0.9am
-------------

* Added in example plugin custom commands to display server stats. Be sure to have it enabled in your `~/.siriproxy/config.yml` 

    Say: 'How many keys' and Siri replies with the available keys

    Say: 'How many active connections' and Siri replies with the current active connections

* Added recommended values in gentables functions. Please regenerate your Tables. Keep in mind that this will destroy all data in db!

* Added premature admin login and settings change via web. See webInterface/inc/config.inc.php

* Added max connections per key!

* Changed method about the keyload increases. Now its based upon session utilization!

* Fixed a bug where when a key expired and a client established a connection the wrong key was marked expired

* Fixed a bug where when a 4s would connect and its not setup the server did not recognize it

* Bug fixes


**Recommended default values**

* Max Connections per key: default=15

* Max Keyload: default=500

* Keyload Dropdown: default=100~125

* Keyload Dropdown Interval: default=1200~1800



Version 0.8b
------------

* Fixed several bugs, added email notifications, key protection and much more


**Updating from v.0.7**

There is no need to do anything more (create db etc) than these steps

1. Run `siriproxy update`

2. Edit ` ~/.siriproxy/config.yml` with the new email setup lines from `config.example.yml` !

3. Start the server `siriproxy server`

4. (Optional) Update to the new webinterface. Just copy all files from `webInterface/` to your html/docs and dont forget to edit the database connection info in `inc/connection.inc.php`

    



Features
--------

* Authentication 

* Ban protection

* Improved statistics

* User device logging

* User logging

* Improved connection limits 

* Improved Grabber

* Plugins api and config capable (NEW)

* Email Notifications when the key expires (NEW) - Don't forget to setup your email on the config.yml

* MySql Database connection support: Supports MySQL database connection for storing configuration,keys and runtime statistics. Now you can edit and build that (NEW)

* Multiple key support: You can connect more than 1 iPhone4S and store even more keys. The more the keys, the more the clients!

* Key Throttling: Each client uses a different key, if more than one Keys are available. The throttler makes sure that each Key is throttled thus enabling several client registration and assistant object creation.

* KeyLoad Safeguard: Never worry about how many people use your iPhone4S key. Each Key has a maximum keyload. Even when the key is still valid, if the keyload limit is exceeded, the safeguard disables the key and protects the iPhone4S from getting banned.

* KeyLoad Aware: Checks what key is not "Hot" anymore and periodically decreases the load, thus re-enabling Safeguarded Keys

* Web interface and monitoring: Always know what is happening without a CLI! With a web interface you can check statistics such as active connections, valid keys, server load, keyload etc.

* One certificate for all devices: Both Siri Capable devices (currently only iPhone4s) and older devices are using the same certificate and the same port (443 default for SSL)

* One instance of the server: Due to one certificate you can run only one instance of the server.

* Bug Free (I hope...) :-) Never worry if the server has crashed. Most of the bugs that were causing the server to crash are fixed now.


Notice About Plugins
--------------------

We recently changed the way plugins work very significantly. That being the case, your old plugins won't work. 

New plugins should be independent Gems. Take a look at the included [example plugin](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/tree/master/plugins/siriproxy-example) for some inspiration. We will try to keep that file up to date with the latest features. 


Set-up Instructions
-------------------


**Tutorial for Ubuntu is now here**

Thanks to am3yrus we have a tutorial for ubuntu lovers: [http://www.am3yrus.com/](http://www.am3yrus.com/)

Also the above site holds different setup instructions.
If you go for the above tutorial then there is no need to follow any instructions below. 



**Set up DNS**

* __Not needed if you Jailbrake an iPhone 4S. Just add http://cydia.myrepospace.com/thpryrchn/ to your cydia Sources, and install `Spire 4S` on your 4S. Then you can point it to your server just like you do with any other iPhone 4.__

Before you can use SiriProxy, you must set up a DNS server on your network to forward requests for guzzoni.apple.com to the computer running the proxy (make sure that computer is not using your DNS server!). I recommend dnsmasq for this purpose. It's easy to get running and can easily handle this sort of behavior. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s))
Also if you dont have static ip you can use this dns python server. ([https://github.com/jimmykane/Roque-Dns-Server])


**Set up RVM and Ruby 1.9.3**

If you don't already have Ruby 1.9.3 installed through RVM, please do so in order to make sure you can follow the steps later. Experts can ignore this. If you're unsure, follow these directions carefully:

1. Download and install RVM (if you don't have it already):

	* Download/install RVM:  

		`bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)`  

	* Activate RVM:  

		`[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"`  

	* (optional, but useful) Add RVM to your .bash_profile:  

		`echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function' >> ~/.bash_profile`   

2. Install Ruby 1.9.3 (if you don't have it already):   

	`rvm install 1.9.3`  

3. Set RVM to use/default to 1.9.3:   

	`rvm use 1.9.3 --default`


**Setup MySQL**

Install MySQL on your system and create a database called siri or whatever you like. 

1. Connect to mysql 
    
	`mysql -h localhost -u root -p `

2. Create the Database

	`CREATE DATABASE siri;`

	
**Set up The Three Little Pigs**

Clone this repo locally, then navigate into the The-Three-Little-Pigs directory (the root of the repo). Then follow these instructions carefully. Note that nothing needs to be (or should be) done as root until you launch the server:

1. Clone the repo

	`git clone https://github.com/jimmykane/The-Three-Little-Pigs-Siri-Proxy`

2. Change path to it

	`cd The-Three-Little-Pigs-Siri-Proxy`
    
3. Install Rake and Bundler:  

	`sudo gem install rake bundler`  

4. Install SiriProxy gem (do this from your SiriProxy directory):  

	`rake install`  

5. Make .siriproxy directory:  

	`mkdir ~/.siriproxy`  

6. Move default config file to .siriproxy (if you need to make configuration changes, do that now by editing the config.yml):  

	`cp ./config.example.yml ~/.siriproxy/config.yml`  

7. Edit `~/.siriproxy/config.yml` and put your database info

        db_host: 'localhost'
        db_user: 'root'
        db_pass: 'yourpassword'
        db_database: 'siri'

8. Edit your `~/.siriproxy/config.yml` and put your server info for certs

        ca_name: 'SiriProxyCA'
        server1: 'guzzoni.apple.com'
        server2: 'your.siri.proxy.server.com'

9. Generate certificates.   

	`siriproxy gencerts`



10. Install `~/.siriproxy/ca.pem` on all your devices including iphone4s etc. This can easily be done by emailing the file to yourself and clicking on it in the iPhone email app. Follow the prompts.

11. Bundle SiriProxy (this should be done every time you change the config.yml):  

	`siriproxy bundle`

12. Create the tables needed for the database. You will only need to do this once. Keep in mind that this will delete all DATA on the tables such as keys and config data

	`siriproxy gentables`

13. Start SiriProxy (must start as root because it uses a port < 1024):  

	`sudo siriproxy server`

	You can also start the server by a re-open script that ensures to restart the server if it crashes

	`./siriproxy-restarter`

14. Test that the server is running by saying "Test Siri Proxy" to your phone.


Note: on some machines, rvmsudo changes "`~`" to "`/root/`". This means that you may need to symlink your "`.siriproxy`" directory to "`/root/`" in order to get the application to work:  

	sudo ln -s ~/.siriproxy /root/.siriproxy


**Installing the Web Interface**

Make sure you have apache2,mysql,php,php-mysql in common words LAMP setup up and ready.

A documentation on how to do this on Ubuntu is here. ([https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP])

1. Edit the `webInterface/inc/config.inc.php` and enter the database connection info and your dns info admin pass etc

2. Create the certificate folder `mkdir webInterface/certificates`

3. Copy the certificate from `~/.siriproxy/ca.pem` to `webInterface/certificates/ca.pem`

4. Copy all files under webInterface to your apache html docs folder

5. (Optional) Open `pages` folder on your htlm folder path and delete whatever page you dont want! Also edit `pages/pages.xml` with the stuff you need!

    

**Updating SiriProxy**

Once you're up and running, if you modify the code, or you want to grab the latest code from GitHub, you can do that easily using the "siriproxy update" command. Here's a couple of examples:

`siriproxy update`  
	
Installs the latest code from the [master] branch on GitHub.
	
`siriproxy update /path/to/SiriProxy`  

Installs the code from /path/to/SiriProxy

        siriproxy gentables


** Starting your SiriProxy server **

1. Go to the directory where it was cloned to. Usually this:

	`cd ~/The-Three-Little-Pigs-Siri-Proxy/`


	Start SiriProxy 

	* If you are using port less than 1024 (must start as root because it uses a port < 1024):  

		`rvmsudo siriproxy server`

	* 1025 or higher

		`siriproxy server`


    You can also start the server by a re-open script that ensures to restart the server if it crashes

     * Port 1024 or less

		`rvmsudo ./siriproxy-restarter`

	* Port 1025 or higher

		`./siriproxy-restarter`


2. Test that the server is running by saying "Test Siri Proxy" to your phone.


**Installing the Web Interface on Mac**

Make sure you enable Web Sharing in System Preferences.

1. Edit the `webInterface/inc/config.inc.php` and enter the database connection info and your dns info admin pass etc

2. Create the certificate folder `mkdir ~/The-Three-Little-Pigs-Siri-Proxy/webInterface/certificates`

3. Copy the certificate from `~/.siriproxy/ca.pem` to `webInterface/certificates/ca.pem`

	`cp ~/.siriproxy/ca.pem ~/The-Three-Little-Pigs-Siri-Proxy/webInterface/certificates/ca.pem`

4. Copy all files under webInterface to your /Library/WebServer/Documents/ folder

5. (Optional) Open `pages` folder on your htlm folder path and delete whatever page you dont want! Also edit `pages/pages.xml` with the stuff you need!

6. Enable PHP because it isn't by default on a mac

	`sudo nano nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf` 

	around line 111 uncomment this line: 

	`LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so`

7. Setup PHP with it's defaults.

		sudo cp -p /etc/php.ini.default /etc/php.ini
		sudo chmod 666 /etc/php.ini

8. Restart Apache

	`sudo apachectl restart`

9. In your browser, try out your server!

	`http://localhost`



    

**Updating SiriProxy**

Once you're up and running, if you modify the code, or you want to grab the latest code from GitHub, you can do that easily using the "siriproxy update" command. Here's a couple of examples:

	`siriproxy update`  
	
Installs the latest code from the [master] branch on GitHub.

**Problems with DNS and Iphone4S not connecting? (Not showing in command line)**

If you are using ubuntu please consider that many Ubuntu installations run the named DNS server. To use the DNSMASQ server do the dollowing at each reboot:

	sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq stop -> To stop DNS Server
	sudo killall named -> to stopped stupid named service (another dns server)
	sudo /et/init,d/dnsmasq start -> to restart dnsserver

**My Siri isn't working on my device, but it does connect to my Siriproxy, and I have 4S keyes**

Try Deleting your com.apple.assistant.plist. You can do this by putting `cydia://package/mobi.macciti.assistantdelete` in safari on your iDevice, or just search `assistantdelete` in cydia.

**Gem is not installing?**

0. Type rvm requirements and install all packages that RVM proposes!

1. Review the error output and run the manual install as suggested.

2. Notice the missing libraries. My usual missing ones are mysql-devel,zlib,zlib-devel,libxml2.



**How do I remove the certificate from my iPhone when I'm done?**

Just go into your phone's Settings app, then go to "General->Profiles." Your CA will probably be the only thing listed under "Configuration Profiles." It will be listed as "SiriProxyCA" Just click it and click "Remove" and it will be removed. (Thanks to [@tidegu](http://www.twitter.com/tidegu) for asking!)

This software is provided as-is with no warranty whatsoever. Apple could do things to block this kind of behavior if they want.

They can, and I wouldn't blame them if they do.
