# This is a "hello world" style plugin. It simply intercepts the phrase "test siri proxy" and responds
# with a message about the proxy being up and running (along with a couple other core features). This 
# is good base code for other plugins.
# 
# Remember to add other plugins to the "config.yml" file if you create them!
######

#Note about returns from filters:
# - Return false to stop the object from being forwarded
# - Return a Hash to substitute or update the object
# - Return nil (or anything not a Hash or false) to have the object forwarded (along with any 
#    modifications made to it)
